          Hey, it's your girl Queenie Chats with Queenie is mine, your and our
          safe space to chit-chat. It's your hangout place where we chat and
          listen to cool people on how they can empower others by sharing about
          their lifestyle, knowledge or wisdom. We want this space to be
          inspiring for young adults who are finding their way in this big small
          world. I started this idea mid-2018 when I took a break off work,
          social responsibilities and wanted to find my voice/place in the media
          industry. I love telling stories, I love listening to stories, I love
          seeing others get through adversities, I have been told to shush
          because I talk too much - so why not make use of what I have and put
          it into good use. We all come across beautiful souls that when you
          listen to their story or opinion of something it sparks a convo in
          your head. Some of these cool people share their growth from adversity
          and wanna inspire others when life strikes you out big time.
